# My Personal NixOS configuration

I try to store all my nix configuration in the same tree: this repository.

Might not be super interesting but I still publish it as it may help other
to discover new configuration patterns/tricks.

You probably don't want to copy it as it is but instead steal some bits
and adapt them for your own configuration.
